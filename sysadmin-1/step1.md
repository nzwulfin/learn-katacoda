No sooner had I sat down at my desk when Jack came rushing over to me with an urgent request.

"Selina, one of the guys from the appdev team needs us to deploy an updated app before the sportsball playoffs start this weekend!"

"It is ticket number 89882772, looks like he attached an RPM package with the application."

'Ok, I am right on it.'
