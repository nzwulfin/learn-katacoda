# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, modify, and
troubleshoot changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux's system-wide cryptographic
policy.  The scenario uses the Apache web server as the example application.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Verify the current system-wide cryptographic policy setting
* Change the current cryptographic policy setting
* Troubleshoot applications after a cryptographic policy update
* Modify application settings to comply with stronger cryptograpic policies

# Example Use case:
Your security team requires using stronger cryptography algorithms with
applications and is no longer allowing weaker algorithms, such as SHA-1.
