# Logging in and navigating Web Console 

Now that the required software is installed, it is time to configure and
enable terminal session recording.  You will use the Web Console to perform
this task.

Use the *Web Console* tab in your lab environment to log into the Web
Console for the system.  You should use the following credentials:

Username: __rhel__  
Password: __redhat__

Now that you are logged into the Web console, and because you have installed
the __cockpit-session-recording__ rpm package, you can now select the
*Session Recording* option in the left-side navigation menu.
