# Commit changes

Now that you have updated the contents of the blueprint, spend some time exploring the organization of the blueprint contents. Note that blueprint contents can also be filtered, and when contents are added, their dependencies are automatically pulled in. Try filtering the blueprint contents by "npm" to see if it was automatically included in the blueprint as a dependency. Or click the Undo button to see how the number of dependencies changed when you added nodejs.

When you are ready, click the **Commit** button to commit your changes.
