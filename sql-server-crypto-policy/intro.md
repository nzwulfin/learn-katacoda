# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, and modify
Red Hat Enterprise Linux's system-wide cryptographic policy applied to 
Microsoft SQL Server, and encrypt a database in SQL Server using SQL Server's 
Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) feature.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Verify the current system-wide cryptographic policy setting
* Change the current cryptographic policy setting
* Connect to SQL Server using a strongly encrypted TLS connection 
* Configure TDE in SQL Server to encrypt a database at rest

# Example Use case:
Your security team requires using stronger cryptography algorithms with
applications and is no longer allowing weaker algorithms with lower bit 
lengths. They also require encryption of sensitive data at rest.
